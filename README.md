OpenCV-Sentry
=============

An intro to openCV using a webcam-augmented DreamCheeky Storm nerf turret to defend your desk.    


Simple C like program to teach to some fellow students on how to use OpenCV, and basics about USB commands.   
Requires OpenCV2.* and libUSB (and well, the sentry can be bought on thinkgeek or somewhere. Then strap a webcam on it.)
